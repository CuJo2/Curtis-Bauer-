\f0\fs24 \cf0 What I have right now for my soundscape narrative is the sounds of a person walking with birds chirping to sound like your are walking in the forrest. I also have the sounds of wind picking up as you get the feeling that a storm is about to come. What I envision this project to be in the end is that you feel like you are walking in the forrest and then a thunderstorm appears out of nowhere. }
